# philomina-wp-child
This is a child theme of the [Philomina](https://github.com/charlieasemota/philomina-wp) WordPress theme which has been customized to suit the requirements of [Sherrie Finds Fashion](www.sherriefindsfashion.com).

This is not intended for distribution as a theme but is instead intended to simply share the modifications I've made.

- Removed "Continue" button and made the entire image clickable
- Added widget area to the bottom of the theme on home and posts.
- Changed the behavior of the images because all my images are cropped and sized before upload
